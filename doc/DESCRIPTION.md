Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.
This Yunohost package will install Dex and setup a canonical OpenID Connect provider for your Yunohost instance, based on the LDAP user base, that can then be used as an authentification server for other Yunohost apps.

### Features

- Fully working OpenID Connect authentification flow
- Interfaced with Yunohost's LDAP server
